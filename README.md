# Generalized Debye-Huckel Model
We propose a generalized Debye-Huckel model from Poisson-Fermi theory to predict the mean activity coefficient of
electrolytes in water-methanol mixtures with arbitrary percentage of methanol from 0 to 100%. The model applies
to any number of ionic species and accounts for both short and long ion-ion, ion-water, ion-methanol, and water-methanol interactions, the size effect of all particles, and the dielectric effect of mixed-solvent solutions. We also
present a numerical algorithm with mathematical and physical details for using the model to fit or predict experimental
data. The model has only 3 empirical parameters to fit the experimental data of NaF, NaCl, and NaBr, for example,
in pure-water solutions. It then uses another 3 parameters to predict the activities of these salts in mixed-solvent
solutions for any percentage of methanol. Values of these parameters show mathematical or physical meaning of ionic
activities under variable mixing condition and salt concentration. The algorithm can automatically determine optimal
values for the 3 fitting parameters without any manual adjustments.
